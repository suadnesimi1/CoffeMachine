# CoffeMachine

algorithm

create a coffe machine
first of all put your coins
select coffe type 
select sugar level of the coffe
take your product


let explain a little bit our code:

in first step we create a scanner class where user asked to put coins. if coins are enough or true then let it to
continue, if coins are not enough or false give an error.
second step we should selecet what kind of coffee do we want. to di this in java we use switch statement
third step is to selecet the suger level, this part is the same with the second step. also here we use switch statement.
and now we see that we have two switch statements. to implement both of them we should use the nested switch statement.
and the final part is to print the line take your product.

--- what should be put extra in our code---

in the final part of 4th step, i want to write a code that should control all the satements before, and to wait around 10 second,
before printing the line take your product. -> this is my goal right now.
